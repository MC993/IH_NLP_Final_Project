# Antiviolence - NLP Project

Welcome!
This project focuses on detecting emotions from text and identifying whether the text contains hate speech or violent language.

I developed three different RoBERTa-based models to handle these tasks, using a pre-trained tokenizer for efficient processing and the Adam optimizer to improve training precision.

## What’s Inside
Emotion Detection: Classify the emotional tone of text.

Hate Speech and Violence Detection: Identify potentially harmful or violent language.

antiviolence.py: A standalone script you can run to test the model on your own text inputs.

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the Jupyter Notebook to review the training and evaluation process.

Run antiviolence.py after setting up your environment to test the models yourself!

## Contributions
Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or extend the models further. I’d love to see what you come up with!
